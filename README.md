Udacity Project 1: Portfolio Website

      Description:
      
    This is an interactive website created to satisfy the requirements for project 1, which utilises materials and info learned from the intro to HTML/CSS, Responsive Web Design and Responsive Images courses. It is a single webpage with interactivity in images and responsiveness in design so it may be viewed optimally on a range of devices. It is structured as follows:
    
    -Header: Contains an interactive Udacity logo when hovered over with the mouse, and a title/role of the site creator
    -Middle: Contains a main image in the centre of the page
    -Featured Work: Contains 3 images in a row represented as large thumbnails with a title and link to view it.
    -Using Bootstrap CSS and JS, when featured work images are clicked on they will open a small window in the page centre displaying the image, it's title and a short description.
    -Using a combo of Bootstrap and media queries/styling hardcoded, the page will responsively adjust to different screen sizes and provide optimal viewing for the user.
